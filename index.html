          <h3><a name="mentoring" class="anchor" href="#mentoring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>May 21, 2014, Mentoring</h3>

          <p>Recently I decided to level up in my career so I signed up for a month of mentoring with <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a>. So far this seems to have been a wise decision, although I have yet to actually meet with my mentor or get any real personalized feedback from the mentoring team.</p>

          <p>My goals for this endeavor are as such:
          <ol>
            <li>better understanding and mastery of Rails</li>
            <li>feel more confident when using a TDD approach that I'm writing the right tests</li>
            <li>make the transition from writing code that just works to writing code that is well designed
            <li>return to my VI roots and start using VIM!</li>
            <li>transfer some of my visual artistic skills to pixels by learning web design fundamentals</li>
          </ol>
          Signing up for mentoring coincided with a major overhaul of my <a href="http://www.lisafeather.com">artist web site</a>, so I began with the "Design for Developers" course. This gave me some ideas, although I have yet to really formalize the process with a bunch of sketches and more experimentation with layout. </p>

          <p>The site currently has over 250 works of art on it, all images of different sizes. Getting all of that into nicely formatted responsive grids with appropriate white space is a challenge. So, yeah, work in progress! My goal was a visually inviting site that feels like a coffee table book and is fun to navigate, even on mobile devices.<a href="mailto:lisafeather@gmail.com">Feedback</a> welcome!</p>

          <p>I've also nearly completed the "Intermediate Rails" series, and have learned a lot about breaking Rails apps down into modular parts so they are more easily extended. This series also sets you up nicely for the course on TDD, as you do a lot of refactoring. He urges you to think about what you want new functionality to do before you think about how to implement it.</p>

          <p>Overall I am very happy with the two courses and feel I've learned a lot in a short while. One great resource that was pointed to in this course was <a href="http://vimeo.com/12350535">this video</a> of a lecture on SOLID principles by Sandi Metz. She refactors code to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> pattern, among other things, so your code is easier to extend and test. We have Martin Fowler to thank for that original idea that seems to have been really popularized in the Angular community.</p>

          <p>Another thing we learned about was using Ruby objects as models by creating classes in your models directory that don't inherit from ActiveRecord. This is a seriously cool way to break your functionality down into classes that just do one thing. Classes like that are, of course, easier to test and therefore easier to change. Wheeeee! Coding is fun again.</p>

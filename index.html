          <h3><a name="mentoring" class="anchor" href="#mentoring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>May 21, 2014, Mentoring</h3>

          <p>Recently I decided to level up in my career so I signed up for a month of mentoring with <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a>. So far this seems to have been a wise decision, although I have yet to actually meet with my mentor or get any real personalized feedback from the mentoring team.</p>

          <p>My goals for this endeavor are as such:
          <ol>
            <li>better understanding and mastery of Rails</li>
            <li>feel more confident when using a TDD approach that I'm writing the right tests</li>
            <li>make the transition from writing code that just works to writing code that is well designed
            <li>return to my VI roots and start using VIM!</li>
            <li>transfer some of my visual artistic skills to pixels by learning web design fundamentals</li>
          </ol>
          Signing up for mentoring coincided with a major overhaul of my <a href="http://www.lisafeather.com">artist web site</a>, so I began with the "Design for Developers" course. This gave me some ideas, although I have yet to really formalize the process with a bunch of sketches and more experimentation with layout. </p>

          <p>The site currently has over 250 works of art on it, all images of different sizes, so it's kind of a monster. Getting all of that into a nicely formatted grid that is responsive and has appropriate white space around it is a challenge. So, work in progress. My goal was a site that felt like a coffee table book, that invited exploration and felt unstressful to navigate. So far people have been reporting back that it's fun to look at. <a href="mailto:lisafeather@gmail.com">Feedback</a> welcome!</p>

          <p>I've also nearly completed the "Intermediate Rails" series, and have learned a lot about how to make Rails apps that are better written so they are more easily extended.</p>

          <p>Overall I am very happy with the two courses and feel I've learned a lot in a short while. One great resource that was pointed to in this course was <a href="http://vimeo.com/12350535">this video</a> of a lecture on SOLID principles by Sandi Metz. She refactors code to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a> pattern, among other things, so your code is easier to extend and test.</p>

          <p>Another thing we learned about that was new to me was using Ruby objects as models by creating classes in your models directory that don't inherit from ActiveRecord. This is a seriously cool way to simplify code and break it down into classes that just do one thing. Classes like that are easier to test and therefore easier to change. Wheeeee!</p>

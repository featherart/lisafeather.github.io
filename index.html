          <h3><a name="mentoring" class="anchor" href="#mentoring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>May 21, 2014, Mentoring</h3>

          <p>Recently I decided to level up in my career so I signed up for a month of mentoring with <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a>. So far this seems to have been a wise decision, although I have yet to actually meet with my mentor or get any real personalized feedback from the mentoring team.</p>

          <p>My goals for this endeavor are as such:
          <ol>
            <li>better understanding and mastery of Rails</li>
            <li>more confidence that I'm writing the right tests when using TDD</li>
            <li>make the transition from writing code that just works to writing code that is robust & well designed
            <li>return to my VI roots and start using VIM</li>
            <li>transfer some of my visual skills to pixels by learning web design fundamentals</li>
          </ol>
          Signing up for mentoring coincided with a major overhaul of my <a href="http://www.lisafeather.com">artist web site</a>, so I began with the "Design for Developers" course. This gave me some ideas, although I have yet to really formalize the process with a bunch of sketches and more experimentation with layout. </p>

          <p>The site currently has over 250 works of art on it, all images of different sizes. Getting all of that into nicely formatted responsive grids with appropriate white space is a challenge. So, yeah, work in progress! My goal was a visually inviting site that feels like a coffee table book and is fun to navigate, even on mobile devices.<a href="mailto:lisafeather@gmail.com"> Feedback</a> welcome!</p>

          <p>I've also just completed the "Intermediate Rails" series. This course assumes you know your way around a Rails app but that you might be guilty of making large, unweildy controllers that have all kinds of crazy methods that do things beyond the scope of the 7 restful actions. You also might not know how to break code down so your app is more modular. Strong parameters are also explained, even though he doesn't use a Rails 4 app. We refactor a lot, breaking the test app down into modular parts so they are more easily extended. </p>

          <p>This series also sets you up nicely for the course on TDD, as he urges you to think about what you want new functionality to do before you think about how to implement it. So you write code that causes error messages then fix it.</p>

          <p>Overall I am very happy with the two courses and feel I've learned a lot in a short while. There are a lot of further learning resources provided. One I really enjoyed was <a href="http://vimeo.com/12350535">this video</a> of a lecture on SOLID principles by Sandi Metz. She refactors code to use the more relevant parts of SOLID (for Ruby it's only SOD) so your code is easier to extend and test. She discusses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a>, which is a term you also hear bandied about in the Angular world. Regardless of all that hot debate over TDD right now, I hope we can still all agree that testable code is better code!</p>

          <p>Another thing we learned about was using concerns and using Ruby objects as models by creating classes in your models directory that don't necessarily inherit from ActiveRecord. This is a seriously cool way to break your functionality down into classes that just do one thing. Classes like that are, of course, easier to test and therefore easier to change. Wheeeee! Coding is fun again!</p>

            Factory Girl
          </h3>
          <p>First of all, what a cool retro-futuristic name! Who knows if it's a reference to the film about Andy Warhol's muse, or the Rolling Stones song. Maybe neither. More likely it's a nod towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">design pattern</a>.</p>
            <img src="http://wunderbuzz.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/factorygirl_.jpg" height=300 />

            <p>It's also pretty nifty as a testing tool. Why, you ask? First off, as the name implies, it gives you a factory for <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mocks</a> of objects you want to test. Suppose that your code focuses on one particular object, the Cookie. It has two attributes, flavor and crunch level. You might drive out your cookie jar functionality with a test something like this:</p>

            <pre><code>
            feature 'monitor cookie supply' do
              scenario 'last cookie is eaten' do
                Cookie.create(flavor: 'chocolate bomb', crunch_level: 'ear-rattling')
                user_eats_cookie('messy')
                user_licks_lips
                expect(cookie.jar.length).to eq 0
              end
            end
            </pre></code>

            <p>This code will work if you have only a few tests that deal with cookies of different flavors. But suppose you are a supplier to the Cookie Monster, and you have to keep track of many cookies? In that case you might use the gem 'factory_girl_rails'. This gem requires a few minimal configurations before you are ready to rock. First, open up your spec_helper.rb file and add this line towards the bottom:</p>

            <pre><code>
            config.include FactoryGirl::Syntax::Methods
            </pre></code>

            <p>Now you can refactor your tests to refer to the cookie factory rather than creating a new Cookie for each scenario.</p>

           <pre><code>
            feature 'monitor cookie supply' do
              scenario 'last cookie is eaten' do
                create(:cookie, flavor: 'chocolate bomb', crunch_level: 'ear-rattling')
                user_eats_cookie('messy')
                user_licks_lips
                expect(cookie.jar.length).to eq 0
              end
            end
            </pre></code>

            <p>Now if you run your test just like this, Rspec will complain that the factory "cookie" does not exist. So you also need to add a file 'factories.rb' to your spec/ directory where you create the cookie factory. <p>

            <pre><code>
            FactoryGirl.define do
              factory :cookie do
                flavor: 'chocolate chip walnut'
                crunch_level: 'medium'
              end
            end
            </pre></code>

            <p>That's it! Now every time you want to mock out a Cookie, all you have to do is refer to the cookie factory. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">Factory Girl</a>!</p>

             Outside-in TDD - making life simple
          </h3>
          <p>First off, I'd just like to point out that Capybaras, the animals, are incredibly cute. Also, why is it that animals wearing glasses or goggles are automatically at least 65% more adorable?! This is a big question that Science needs to address ASAP. </p>

          <p>Next I'd like talk about what I've recently learned with respect to Outside-in TDD using tools like <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/capybara">Capybara</a>, the Ruby gem.</p>
          <img src="images/capybara.jpg" height=300 />

          <p>Although I am not new to web technologies, TDD is a relatively new concept for me. Who had time to test while running from a raging t-rex? Traditionally, code was written by developers and tested by testers. Many developers test their own code now but it is often passed through a QA team before it moves out of staging into production.</p>

          <p>When I first moved from static HTML pages to writing Perl CGI apps, we tested manually. For even the tiniest change you'd spend hours repeatedly clicking through each fixture like a brain-dead monkey, inevitably forgetting something important your first user would surely uncover.</p>

          <p>Luckily, times have changed! Coming to TDD late in the game has presented its own challenges, but has advantages too. I see why, but have struggled with how. Even after beginning to understand the syntax of Rspec, I still wondered where to start. The wildly different views in this arena didn't help, either. The Wikipedia entry on  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">integration tests</a> says it happens once all the unit testing is complete. Proponents of Outside-in testing give the opposite advice. <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">DHH</a> thinks we should focus on regression testing and TDD is dead because of it's propensity to create over-architected solutions. His objection seems mostly to have been met with raised eyebrows and a collective shrug from the Rails community. </p>

          <p>My first real experience of writing Rspec tests on the job involved writing integration tests then controller tests to add new functionality. I was also asked to fill in any missing controller tests so our coverage would be more complete. At the time I was not confident enough to point out that this seemed redundant in some cases, as integration tests had covered controller actions nicely. We were working in a continuous integration environment, so once tests went green new changes got deployed. Things that had not been tested properly would go into production, sometimes causing errors our users would catch. Yikes! Having a monkey-bot click through your site for you is great, but a simple visual click-through before changes go live isn't maybe a terrible idea either.</p>

          <p>By the time I started to learn about Outside-In TDD, I felt pretty comfortable writing controller tests after the fact. Yes, I know, this is not TDD! In fact, many of those who espouse the concept of Outside-In TDD will tell you that writing controller tests often ends up being redundant, as you have already tested your actions through the integration tests. Your unit tests focus mainly on your models. </p>

          <p>The idea is to begin with how you want your app to behave (the "B" in BDD), write integration tests, then drill down into unit tests. Tests focus on results, not implementation. This answers the question of "where to start?" Think first about how your app should behave, write failing tests that specify this behavior, make them green, then refactor. You limit yourself to the most simple failing test, then only write enough code to make it pass in the most inane way possible. What?! My brain cries out to overthink this. It's an exercise in being completely pedantic. It's as if you were a robot who only knows a few basic rules and executes them repeatedly. Don't get me wrong. I have much love for robots, but do I want to become one?!</p>

          <p>The simplicity of this approach is really starting to grow on me, however. It frees up so much space in your head when you are forced to focus on one thing at a time. Rather than turning you into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtTL0A5nhfk&feature=kp">Bender</a>, it keeps you staring directly at the functionality you want. By not overthinking implementation details in the beginning, you can focus on how you want your code to act. No one will even require you to do the robot dance when you are through! </p>

          <p>Capybara, the gem, is like a tiny monkey who runs through all the boring mechanics of testing your views so you never even have to open a web browser during the development process. If you do things the way you ought (envision giant pointing finger here) your controller will only use restful actions, the results of which will have been tested through your views.</p>

          <pre><code>
            feature "communicate with humans" do
              scenario "indicate a response" do
                visit robot_path
                fill_in "Question", with: "Answer"
                assert_response "bleep!"
              end
            end
          </code></pre>

              VIM + Climbing
          </h3>
          <p>Early in my dabbling with UNIX I learned to use the VI editor. This has been very handy over time. When I was living in Thailand rock climbing and dive guiding full time for 6 months, it was a great way to edit and update remote files. I could take a boat to the nearest town to visit a janky little internet cafe and log in to my servers overseas using a DOS window. This way I could keep a travel log to stay closer with with friends and family back home. </p>
          <img src="images/thailand2.jpg" height=300 />

          <p>Many years later I am trying to return to my VI roots with VIM. It reminds me a bit of when I first learned to lead climb. Until I met climbing, I was terrible at every sport. No one wanted me on their team. Climbing is more a brain game, where even the weak can technique through difficult moves. In leading, everything is harder and scarier, but the payoff is worth it. The thing I feared most was falling while clipping the rope. So I practiced this off the wall until it was muscle memory. Now I can clip quickly, even under duress, freeing up my focus for solving the crux of the climb.</p>

          <p>The same must be said of learning to use your favorite code editor. You need to be able to use it without thinking, so you are not fumbling for keys and you can focus on more important tasks. Using keystrokes to navigate and edit files makes it easier to have an uninterrupted flow of thought. </p>

          <p>Learning to use VIM is not easy at first, even if you have a history with VI, its predecessor. There are some good resources out there. Thoughtbot has a series of videos that are specific to file navigation within Rails apps, as well as several handy shortcuts. 
          Here are some others I found useful:
          <ul>
            <li>Customization w/<a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> allows you to set up colors and to open files using gvim from a command line</li>
            <li>Practice commands <a href="http://www.openvim.com/">with prompts</a></li>
            <li>Develop muscle memory <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">while having fun </a>(sort of)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>However difficult it may be to learn VIM, it is still easier than this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VLj4KRrMPM">training routine</a>!</p>

              Mentoring
          </h3>

          <p>Many amazing mentors have crossed my path and changed my life for the better. They have guided me toward a successful art career, better nourishment and training habits, as well as 'learning the ropes' of climbing. Professors can be great, but without the TA I never would have made it through my first programming class in college. Even the crazy, foul-mouthed Scottish former hacker who taught me to navigate UNIX changed my life for the better.</p>

          <p>Mentorship, I believe, is the best way to learn something well. Recently I decided to level up my technical skill set, so I signed up for a month of mentoring with <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a>. While I've never formally paid for mentoring, so far this seems to have been a wise decision. Although I have yet to get any real personalized feedback from the mentoring team, it has focused me on a set of particular goals.</p>

          <p>These are:
          <ol>
            <li>better understanding and mastery of Rails</li>
            <li>more confidence that I'm writing the right tests when using TDD</li>
            <li>make the transition from writing code that just works to writing code that is more well designed
            <li>return to my VI roots and start using VIM</li>
            <li>transfer some of my visual skills to pixels by learning web design fundamentals</li>
          </ol>
          Signing up for mentoring coincided with a major overhaul of my <a href="http://www.lisafeather.com">artist web site</a>, so I began with the "Design for Developers" course. This gave me some ideas, although I need to do more sketches and experimentation with layout and have not gotten any feedback from Thoughtbot's mentoring team here. It's long been my belief that beautiful things are not only easier to use but also generally make life better. There is a joy in things that are made well, so this will continue to haunt me until I get it right. </p>

          <p>The site currently has over 250 works of art on it, all images of different sizes. Getting all of that into nicely formatted responsive grids with appropriate white space is a challenge. So, work in progress! My goal was a visually inviting site that feels like a coffee table book and is fun to navigate, even on mobile devices.<a href="mailto:lisafeather@gmail.com"> Feedback</a> welcome!</p>

          <p>I've also just completed the "Intermediate Rails" series. This course assumes you know your way around a Rails app but that you might be guilty of making large, unweildy controllers that have all kinds of crazy methods that go beyond the scope of the 7 restful actions. You might not know how to break code down so your app is more modular. Strong parameters are also used, even though he doesn't use a Rails 4 app. We refactor a lot, breaking the test app down into modular parts so they are more easily extended. </p>

          <p>This series also sets you up nicely for the course on TDD, as he urges you to think about what you want new functionality to do before you think about how to implement it. You write code that causes error messages then fix it, much like the red, green, refactor cycle espoused by the TDD philosophy.</p>

          <p>Overall I am happy with the courses and feel I've learned a lot in a short while. Further learning resources are good, too. One I enjoyed was <a href="http://vimeo.com/12350535">this video</a> of a lecture on SOLID principles by Sandi Metz. She refactors code to use the more relevant parts of SOLID (for Ruby it's only SOD) so your code is easier to extend and test. She discusses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a>, which is a term you also hear bandied about in the Angular world. Regardless of all the debate over TDD, I hope we can still all agree that modular, testable code is better code!</p>

          <p>Another thing we learn about are concerns and using Ruby objects as models by creating classes in your models directory that don't necessarily inherit from ActiveRecord. This is a seriously cool way to break your functionality down into classes that just do one thing. Classes like that are, of course, easier to test and therefore easier to change. Wheeeee! Coding is fun again!</p>
